Scaling OpenSearch Cluster

TODO: 这篇文档还未完成, 我只是把我能想到的点都写在这里, 以后慢慢改.


Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
通常说到 Scaling 的时候包含两种情况, Scaling Up 和 Scaling Down. 大部分的情况是 Scaling Up, 少数情况需要 Scaling Down. 在 Scaling 的过程中最重要的因素是 Node, Shard 和 内存. 我建议先精读 :ref:`aws-opensearch-sizing-opensearch-cluster`, 了解这几个概念对性能的影响之后再来读本文.

我们先谈 Scaling Up 的情况. 通常之所以需要 Scaling Up 是因为 Cluster 的内存空间满了, 无法增加更多的 Document. 或是一个 Index 的性能达到了瓶颈, 查询速度越来越慢了.

我们再谈 Scaling Down 的情况. 通常之所以需要 Scaling Down 是因为 Cluster 上的内存空间富余太多, 不需要那么多 Node.

本文详细的探讨了针对不同的情况下所需要采取的 Scaling 策略.


Cluster 的内存空间满了

You're correct that adding nodes to an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster does not automatically solve the problem of a hot index receiving increasing read traffic. Adding nodes can provide additional computational resources and improve the overall capacity of the cluster, but it doesn't directly address the issue of distributing the load for a specific index.

To scale an OpenSearch cluster to handle increasing read traffic on a particular index, you have a few options:

1. Increase the number of shards for the hot index:
   - By increasing the number of shards, you can distribute the data and read load across more shards.
   - However, keep in mind that you cannot change the number of shards for an existing index once it's created. You would need to create a new index with the desired number of shards and reindex the data from the old index to the new one.
   - When creating a new index, carefully consider the number of shards based on your expected data volume and query patterns.

2. Leverage replica shards:
   - Replica shards are copies of the primary shards and can help distribute the read load across multiple nodes.
   - Increasing the number of replica shards for the hot index can improve read performance by allowing more nodes to handle read requests in parallel.
   - You can dynamically adjust the number of replica shards for an existing index using the OpenSearch API.

3. Optimize query performance:
   - Analyze and optimize your query patterns to ensure efficient querying on the hot index.
   - Use appropriate indexing techniques, such as creating relevant mappings and analyzers, to improve query performance.
   - Leverage caching mechanisms, such as query result caching or shard request caching, to reduce the load on the cluster for frequently executed queries.

4. Implement index lifecycle management (ILM):
   - Use ILM to automatically manage the lifecycle of your indices based on predefined policies.
   - You can configure ILM to automatically roll over indices based on criteria like index size or time, which can help distribute the load across multiple indices.
   - ILM can also help with managing replica shards and optimizing indices for better performance.

5. Consider data partitioning and index design:
   - If your hot index contains a large amount of data, consider partitioning the data into multiple indices based on a logical partition key (e.g., time-based partitioning).
   - By distributing the data across multiple indices, you can spread the read load and improve query performance.
   - Design your index structure and mappings to align with your query patterns and data access requirements.

It's important to monitor your OpenSearch cluster's performance metrics, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and query latency, to identify bottlenecks and make informed decisions about scaling. OpenSearch provides various monitoring and alerting features to help you track cluster health and performance.

Remember that scaling is an iterative process, and you may need to combine multiple approaches based on your specific use case and requirements. It's recommended to test and validate any changes in a non-production environment before applying them to your production cluster.
