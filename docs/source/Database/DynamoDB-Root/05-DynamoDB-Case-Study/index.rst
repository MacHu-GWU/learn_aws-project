LLM Prompt to brain storm ideas::

    # Objective

    Brainstorm innovative ideas for using Amazon DynamoDB to solve complicated business problem.

    # Instruction

    When generating ideas, consider the following guidelines:

    1. Focus on use cases where Dynamodb can infinitly scale and highly available.
    2. Focus on be able to support complicate business operations using advanced data modeling technique and NoSQL best practice.
    3. Focus on be able to sync data from DynamoDB to analytic data store in near real time.
    4. Focus on the Transaction feature in DynamoDB so that it can support business critical use case.
    5. Focus on the nature of NoSQL that the data schema can evolve over time.
    6. Feel free to use existing internet product use case to create a "re-invent" story.

    # Output Guidelines
.
    1. Present only one idea.
    2. It should include the following sections:
        - business background, introduce the business use case
        - key characteristics of the data, provide high level description and also detailed example.
        - technical challenge, it could have multiple challenge and there's a major one, provide high level description and use a concrete example to show why it's challenge.
        - propose a solution to show that how does the solution solve each technical challenges.

Here's an improved version of your prompt that incorporates your requirements and provides more guidance for generating a detailed and complex business use case:


<objective>
Generate a complex and innovative business use case that can be solved using Amazon DynamoDB, focusing on its ability to scale infinitely, provide high availability, and support advanced data modeling techniques.
</objective>


<instructions>
When generating the use case, consider the following guidelines:

1. Focus on a scenario where DynamoDB's ability to scale infinitely and provide high availability is crucial to the solution.
2. Demonstrate how DynamoDB can support complex business operations using advanced data modeling techniques and NoSQL best practices.
3. Include a requirement to sync data from DynamoDB to an analytic data store in near real-time.
4. Highlight the use of DynamoDB's transaction feature to support business-critical operations.
5. Emphasize the flexibility of NoSQL, allowing the data schema to evolve over time as business requirements change.
6. Feel free to draw inspiration from existing internet product use cases to create a "re-invented" story.
