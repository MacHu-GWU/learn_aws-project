# AWS Q Business vs. Custom RAG Infrastructure Evaluation Task

## 1. Introduction

### Project Objectives
Conduct a thorough comparative analysis between Amazon Q Business (a fully managed AI assistant solution) and building a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) infrastructure using AWS services. This analysis will inform our strategic decision on which approach best serves our enterprise needs for implementing AI assistants across the organization.

### Enterprise Context
- Company size: 10,000 employees
- Potential AI users: 1,000-3,000 employees
- Use case: Internal enterprise AI assistant that can access and utilize company data
- Decision criteria: Cost-effectiveness, scalability, security, and implementation feasibility

## 2. Solution Overview

### AWS Q Business Description
Amazon Q Business is a fully managed generative AI assistant specifically designed for enterprise use. AWS handles all infrastructure, knowledge base management, and AI applications. The customer only needs to provide their data. This solution offers a low-code, straightforward approach to implementing AI capabilities across an enterprise.

### Custom RAG Infrastructure Description
A custom RAG infrastructure involves building and managing your own AI assistant solution using AWS services like Amazon Bedrock, Lambda, Knowledge Bases, and other components. This approach provides greater customization but requires more engineering resources to develop and maintain.

### Key Technology Components
- **AWS Q Business**: Pre-built AI assistant, managed infrastructure, automatic updates, pre-configured security
- **Custom RAG Infrastructure**: Amazon Bedrock, Knowledge Bases, vector stores, Lambda functions, API Gateway, IAM, custom UI/UX, multi-tenant architecture

## 3. Reference Documentation

You will be provided with 5 key documents as a starting point:
- Amazon Q Business Introduction
- Amazon Q Business Features
- Amazon Q Business Pricing
- Multi-tenant RAG with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases
- Multi-tenant AI Knowledge Base Architecture

However, you should conduct independent research to gather additional information from:
- AWS official documentation
- Technical blogs and articles
- Case studies and implementation examples
- Industry analyses and reviews

## 4. Evaluation Criteria

### Cost Analysis (Initial Setup vs. Ongoing)

## Notes for You

1. Focus on providing an objective, evidence-based analysis rather than a predetermined conclusion.
2. Consider both immediate needs and long-term strategic implications.
3. When evaluating costs, consider both direct costs and hidden costs like maintenance, training, and opportunity costs.
4. Identify any assumptions made during your analysis and explain their basis.
5. Feel free to suggest hybrid approaches if they appear most beneficial.
