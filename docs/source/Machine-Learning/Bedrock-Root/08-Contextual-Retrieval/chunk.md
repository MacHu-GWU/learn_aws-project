## Natural Language Meets Automation

AI, and in particular generative AI, is a clear complement to automation — something that close competitors like Tines and Workato have also embraced, as have others in the wider automation world like UiPath. 

If automation and low-code approaches have erased some of the busy work of pulling together how different apps or services worked together, generative AI brings even less technicality into the mix. 

A year and a half ago, Oberhauser said, “we could see this AI thing coming at us.” He quickly surmised that the sweet spot would be to work it into its products, to start to reduce the amount of work it took developers to implement automations by turning instructions into natural language. 

“It’s a prompt to build workflow,” is how Oberhauser describes it. “People don’t really need to write 50 lines of code to integrate the functionality of, say, sending an email.” Now in natural language, you can write “get information from X and send it to Y,” he said. “We see the value in making changes to that more easily.” 

The product was built with a blend of LLMs in mind, and the idea is that if end users are already building services using one LLM or another, it can be swapped in to work with n8n’s platform. And like a number of other developer-focused platforms, n8n has a fairly extensive contributor community that is active on platforms like GitHub, gets involved in forums to help other developers with their questions, and builds and uses workflow templates built by others (n8n also has pre-built a number of workflow templates).
