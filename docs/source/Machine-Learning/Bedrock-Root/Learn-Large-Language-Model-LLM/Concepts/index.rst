Text Completion and Chat in LLM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.. dropdown:: Text Completion and Chat in LLM

    Text completion and chat are related but distinct applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Here's a brief explanation of their differences:

    Text Completion:

    Focus: Text completion focuses on generating or predicting the next word, phrase, or sequence of text based on a given input or context.
    Input: The input for text completion is typically a partial sentence, a prompt, or a specific context.
    Output: The output of text completion is the generated or predicted text that follows the given input.
    Interaction: Text completion often involves a single or limited interaction, where the user provides an input, and the LLM generates a completion.
    Examples: Predictive typing, content generation, code completion.
    Chat:

    Focus: Chat focuses on engaging in interactive conversations and providing contextually relevant responses to user queries or messages.
    Input: The input for chat is a series of messages or queries from the user, forming a conversation.
    Output: The output of chat is a generated response that is contextually appropriate and relevant to the user's message.
    Interaction: Chat involves multiple back-and-forth interactions between the user and the LLM, simulating a conversation.
    Examples: Chatbots, virtual assistants, customer support agents.
    The main difference lies in the nature of the interaction and the desired output. Text completion is more focused on generating or predicting text based on a specific input, while chat is centered around engaging in interactive conversations and providing relevant responses to user queries.

    However, it's important to note that the underlying techniques and principles used in text completion, such as language modeling and context understanding, are also applicable in chat systems. Chat can be seen as an extension or application of text completion, where the model generates responses based on the conversational context and the user's input.

    In practice, many LLMs are versatile and can be fine-tuned or adapted for both text completion and chat tasks, depending on the specific requirements and training data used.
